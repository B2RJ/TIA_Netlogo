# TIA_Netlogo
This project takes place in the teaching unit Technical Articial Intelligence at Lyon 1 University.<br>
We have to implement the propagation of a virus or an epidemic from an open-source simulation provides by NetLogo. 
We add a lot of functionnalities inside the simulation to make real our simulation.

<h2> Getting started</h2>

<ul>
<li>First, you have to download and install NetLogo. It is available here : https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/6.0.2/</li>
<li>After the installation, run NetLogo.</li>
<li>Then, download epiDEM Basic.nlogo from this repository. 
<li>Finally, on NetLogo, file -> open -> epiDEM Basic.nlogo</li>
</ul>

<h2> How to use </h2>
<p> In the "Interface" tab you can change the parameters with the slider or the switch with element in the right side.<br>
In the middle of this tab you have the visualisation of the simulation.<br>
On the left you have the plot to see the evolution over time.<br>
To launch the evolution, firstly click on "setup". Then, click on "go".<br>
You can stop and recreate a simulation thanks this button.</p>
